This code defines a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure using object-oriented programming principles in Python. The code provides methods for various BST operations, such as insertion, deletion, searching, and printing. Let's break down the code step by step and explain each part:

1. `sys.setrecursionlimit(10001)`: Increases the recursion limit to allow deeper recursion.

2. `class BST_Node`: Defines a class `BST_Node` representing a node in the Binary Search Tree.
   - The `__init__` method initializes the node with a `key`, optional `data`, and pointers to the parent (`p`), left child (`left`), and right child (`right`) nodes.

3. `class BSTree`: Defines a class `BSTree` representing the Binary Search Tree.
   - The `__init__` method initializes an empty tree with the `root` set to `None`.

4. Various methods are defined within the `BSTree` class for performing different operations on the BST:
   - `Tree_Maximum`, `Tree_Minimum`: Find the maximum and minimum nodes in a subtree rooted at a given node.
   - `Transplant`: Replaces one subtree with another in the tree.
   - `Tree_Delete`: Deletes a node from the tree.
   - `Tree_Insert`: Inserts a new node into the tree.
   - `Tree_Successor`, `Tree_Predecessor`: Find the successor and predecessor nodes of a given node.
   - `Tree_Search`: Search for a key in the tree and return the corresponding node.
   - `Inorder_Tree_Walk`: Perform an in-order traversal of the tree and print the keys of the nodes.

5. `__printCall` and `print_BSTree`: These methods are used for printing the structure of the BST.
   - `__printCall` is a private method that recursively prints the tree structure with proper indentation and labels.
   - `print_BSTree` is a public method that calls `__printCall` to print the entire tree structure.

6. The `BSTree` class encapsulates all the methods required for creating, modifying, and traversing a Binary Search Tree.

7. The last part of the code defines the main program and creates an instance of the `BSTree` class.
   - The `root` of the tree is created implicitly through the `__init__` method.
   - Various BST operations are performed using the methods provided by the `BSTree` class.
   - The `print_BSTree` method is used to print the structure of the tree.

In summary, this code defines a Binary Search Tree data structure using classes and methods. It encapsulates the operations and attributes of a BST within the `BSTree` class, providing a convenient and organized way to work with BSTs in Python.
